a. Determine the HTTP method used. (5 points)
b. If the method is GET
i. Use a suitable super global variable to find these parameters <temperature>, <location>, and <condition>. (4 points)
ii. Assemble this information into a JSON object. (2 points)
Example: {“temp”: 12, “location”: “Vancouver”, “condition”: “sunny”}
iii. Add an element to the JSON object called “message”. Set the value of this element following these rules: (3 points)


1. If temp is < 16 and condition is raining, set message as “<location> is really cold and wet!”
2. If temp is < 16 and condition is sunny, set message as “<location> is really cold but dry!”
3. If temp is >=16 but <=29 and condition is raining, set message as “Too bad it’s raining in <location>!”
4. If temp is >= 16 and condition is sunny, set message as “What a nice day in <location>”
5. Otherwise set it to “Have a nice day!”
Example of the resulting JSON object:
 {“temp”: 12, “location”: “Vancouver”, “condition”: “sunny”, “message”: “Have a nice day!”}
 
iv. Return a properly JSON formatted string of this object to the client. (1 points)

c. For any HTTP methods other than GET, return a properly JSON formatted string with a message element: “This method is not supported” (2 points)
